# Consumer preference testing of boiled sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) using crowdsourced citizen science in Uganda

We evaluated the *tricot* approach can produce reliable information about consumer preferences. We study consumer preferences related to boiled sweetpotato (*Ipomoea batatas* (L.) Lam.) prepared from six orange fleshed varieties (Ejumula, Kakamega, NASPOT 8, 10, 12 and 13) in three geographic regions of Uganda. We were specifically interested in evaluating if a more independent style of evaluation (*Home tasting*) would produce results comparable to an approach that involves control over preparation (*Community tasting*). Two trials were performed and compared. In Home tasting 276 participants received raw roots in randomised variety combinations  to cook, taste and score at their homes whilst in *Community tasting*, 144 participants received the boiled varieties to taste and score at a centralised location. Participants ranked the varieties in order of overall preference, color, and taste.
